## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images, videos, and PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!

This collection was created for the purpose of users learning more about the care of senior dogs, in particular Miniature Schnauzers. The creator of this collection, Nicole Songstad, has a Miniature Schnauzer named Ralphie who is 13 years old. Ralphie has several health conditions that affect his quality of life. This collection is made available to users who are interested in learning more about caring for their Miniature Schnauzer's typical health conditions.
