<span style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold">About the Collection

<span style="font-family: 'Perpetua', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">This collection was created for the purpose of users learning more about the care of senior dogs, in particular Miniature Schnauzers. The creator of this collection, Nicole Songstad, has a Miniature Schnauzer named Ralphie who is 13 years old. Ralphie has several health conditions that affect his quality of life. This collection is made available to users who are interested in learning more about caring for their Miniature Schnauzer's typical health conditions.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold">Development of Ralphie's Health Conditions</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Perpetua', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">Ralphie, my miniature schnauzer, enjoyed robust health until he reached the age of 9. At this point, we were living in Columbia, MO where he was diagnosed with the slow-developing form of [Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3DFNXvUEH0) at the [Rolling Hills Vet Clinic](https://rollinghillsvethospital.com/), a type of [spinal disease](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/intervertebral-disc-disease) in dogs, and  [allergies](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/ear-disorders/diseases-of-the-pinna/allergy-in-dogs-and-cats) at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). The onset of behaviors associated with [IVDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3DFNXvUEH0) became apparent when he turned 11. After he turned 13, he was diagnosed with [seizures](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/seizures-general-for-dogs) at [VCA Advanced Veterinary Care Center](https://vcahospitals.com/advanced-veterinary-care-center) while we were living in Bloomington, IN. These seizures are not linked to IVDD or any of his other health conditions. His allergy behaviors were first noticeable as mild scratching and biting at his paws and armpit areas when he was 9 years old. This behavior developed over the years until he was diagnosed with [allergies](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/ear-disorders/diseases-of-the-pinna/allergy-in-dogs-and-cats) at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). His veterinarian prescribed an allergy antigen shot that was to be administered at home. After we moved to Indiana, he was reassessed at his primary care veterinary clinic, [Combs Vet Clinic](https://www.combsvetclinic.com/), and was referred to [Animal Allergy and Dermatology Center of Indiana](https://www.aadci.com/) for a formal reassessment of his [allergies](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/ear-disorders/diseases-of-the-pinna/allergy-in-dogs-and-cats).</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Perpetua', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">This development of health conditions is quite typical for the Miniature Schnauzer breed of dog. While the care of a senior dog can be expensive, it is worth the budgeting to see a 13 year old dog still act have the energy of a 5 year old dog.

<span style="font-family: 'Perpetua', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">This is a video of Ralphie having a [seizure](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/seizures-general-for-dogs). You will notice that the seizure lasts for only a matter of seconds. His veterinarian at VCA Advanced Veterinary Care Center said that bringing even a short video like this one to a consultation can help a veterinarian better diagnose a pet's health concern.
