# Development of Ralphie's Health Conditions and Behaviors

Ralphie, my miniature schnauzer, enjoyed robust health until he reached the age of 9. At this point, we were living in Columbia, MO where he was diagnosed with the slow-developing form of [Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3DFNXvUEH0) at the [Rolling Hills Vet Clinic](https://rollinghillsvethospital.com/) and chronic allergies at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). The onset of behaviors associated with IVDD became apparent when he turned 11. After he turned 13, he was diagnosed with seizure-like episodes at [VCA Advanced Veterinary Care Center](https://vcahospitals.com/advanced-veterinary-care-center) while we were living in Bloomington, IN. These seizures are not linked to IVDD or any of his other health conditions. His allergy behaviors were first noticeable as mild scratching and biting at his paws and armpit areas when he was 9 years old. This behavior developed over the years until he was diagnosed with chronic allergies at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). His veterinarian prescribed an allergy antigen shot that was to be administered at home. After we moved to Indiana, he was reassessed at his primary care veterinary clinic, [Combs Vet Clinic](https://www.combsvetclinic.com/), and was referred to [Animal Allergy and Dermatology Center of Indiana](https://www.aadci.com/) for a formal reassessment of his allergies.

# Common Behaviors Associated with Typical Health Conditions

## Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Back Pain:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Dogs with IVDD may exhibit signs of discomfort or pain in the back or neck area.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Reluctance to Move:**

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Hind Limb Weakness:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> IVDD can lead to weakness or paralysis in the hind limbs due to compression of the spinal cord.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Unsteady Gait:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Dogs may have difficulty maintaining balance and may exhibit an unsteady or wobbly gait.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Difficulty or Inability to Stand:**

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Loss of Bladder or Bowel Control:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Compression of the spinal cord can lead to incontinence or difficulty controlling bowel movements.

## Seizures

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Aura (Pre-Ictal Phase):**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Some dogs may exhibit changes in behavior or show signs of anxiety or restlessness before the actual seizure occurs.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Loss of Consciousness:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> During a seizure, a dog may lose consciousness and appear unresponsive to their surroundings.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Muscle Rigidity (Tonic Phase):**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> The muscles may stiffen, causing the dog to fall over or become rigid. This phase is usually brief.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Convulsions (Clonic Phase):**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> This phase involves rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs or the entire body. The dog may paddle their legs or exhibit twitching.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Salivation and Drooling:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Excessive salivation or drooling is common during and after a seizure.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Chomping or Gnashing of Teeth:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> Dogs may exhibit jaw movements, including chomping or gnashing of teeth.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Loss of Bowel or Bladder Control:**

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Post-Ictal Phase:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> After the seizure, a dog may appear disoriented, confused, or tired. Some dogs may seek comfort from their owners during this phase.

<span style="color:blue;">&bull;</span> **Temporary Blindness or Changes in Vision:**
  <span style="color:green;">&bull;</span> In some cases, dogs may experience temporary blindness or changes in vision during a seizure.
