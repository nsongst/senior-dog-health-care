# Development of Ralphie's Health Conditions and Behaviors

Ralphie, my miniature schnauzer, enjoyed robust health until he reached the age of 9. At this point, he was diagnosed with Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) and chronic allergies. The onset of behaviors associated with IVDD became apparent when he turned 11, and it was identified that he had the slow-developing form of IVDD. As he aged, another health challenge emerged, as he began experiencing seizures at the age of 13. Remarkably, these seizures are not linked to IVDD or any of his other health conditions. Ralphie's health journey is a testament to his resilience and the challenges he has faced with grace.
