## Common Behaviors Associated with Typical Health Conditions

This site is generated using [video of IVDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3DFNXvUEH0), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [Consvative Management of IVDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN_Sodwrd68) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
