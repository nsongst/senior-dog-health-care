<span style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold">Development of Ralphie's Health Conditions and Behaviors</span>

Ralphie, my miniature schnauzer, enjoyed robust health until he reached the age of 9. At this point, we were living in Columbia, MO where he was diagnosed with the slow-developing form of [Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3DFNXvUEH0) at the [Rolling Hills Vet Clinic](https://rollinghillsvethospital.com/) and chronic allergies at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). The onset of behaviors associated with IVDD became apparent when he turned 11. After he turned 13, he was diagnosed with seizure-like episodes at [VCA Advanced Veterinary Care Center](https://vcahospitals.com/advanced-veterinary-care-center) while we were living in Bloomington, IN. These seizures are not linked to IVDD or any of his other health conditions. His allergy behaviors were first noticeable as mild scratching and biting at his paws and armpit areas when he was 9 years old. This behavior developed over the years until he was diagnosed with chronic allergies at the [University of Missouri-Columbia Small Animal Hospital](https://vhc.missouri.edu/small-animal-hospital/). His veterinarian prescribed an allergy antigen shot that was to be administered at home. After we moved to Indiana, he was reassessed at his primary care veterinary clinic, [Combs Vet Clinic](https://www.combsvetclinic.com/), and was referred to [Animal Allergy and Dermatology Center of Indiana](https://www.aadci.com/) for a formal reassessment of his allergies.

This development of health conditions is quite typical for the Miniature Schnauzer breed of dog. While the care of a senior dog can be expensive, it is worth the budgeting to see a 13 year old dog still act have the energy of a 5 year old dog.
